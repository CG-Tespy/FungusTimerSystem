# Timer System
For the Fungus Asset Package, which you can get here: https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/releases <br>
This allows you to set up timers for things like countdowns and tracking how long things took. Yes, even how long the player has been playing your game ^^
<br/><br/>
This was made with Fungus 3.13.0 (compatibility version) in Unity 2017.4, with the master branch project set for Unity 2017.4. It should work well for those versions and later.

# Installation
Go to https://github.com/CG-Tespy/TimerSystem/releases/ and download the unitypackage for the version you want.  When the package is done downloading, open your Unity project and install the save system through that package.
